1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- User stories is the best way to discover the users needs. recieving feedback and talking to the users and clients can give the team an idea of the direction the users are looking for, the users will be the ones using the program the most and should have an idea about what features they would like most. The user stories help create an understanding of the users needs and creates a simple description or requirment that the team can use.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- There are different managment ways to approach project development such as the waterfall method and agile methods. The agile process I would want to incorporate the most would be the scrum method and scrum teams. Scrum allows a team to work together in a more flexible way and has a great communication concept of daily scrum meetings where the scrum team gets together for a short meeting and essentially updates everyone on the current progress of the project.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- A good team member is someone who follows the teams standards and style. Being a team player is also important, never put other members down, keep communication high between members, and promote cooperation when needed. Being respectful and maintaining ones own work helps the team move forward.
